# Fluff

<br>
<br> 

**What is it?** 
  
A tiny federated learning framework.  Highly modular with the implementation of (non-standard) Federated Learning algorithms in mind. Fluff supports all features of the Lightning ecosystem for convenience and less boilerplate code.  

<br>
<br> 

**How to use it?** 
  
Some algorithms are implemented in the examples folder.
Currently, the best way to use fluff is to clone the repository and import the modules. 
A Python package and documentation are coming soon.
